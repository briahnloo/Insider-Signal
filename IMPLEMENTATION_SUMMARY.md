## Support & Troubleshooting

### Data Source Not Responding
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key in `.env` (if required)
- System will gracefully use cached data

### Specific Source Issues
- **Market data fails**: Use 4-hour old cache
- **Finnhub fails**: Continue with other 6 sources
- **Polygon fails**: Calculate score without options
- **GDELT fails**: Continue with Finnhub news

All failures are non-blocking. Graceful degradation ensured.

### Check Data Freshness
```python
from src.data_collection.integration_hub import get_data_integration_hub

hub = get_data_integration_hub()
print(hub.get_hub_status()['data_freshness'])
```
