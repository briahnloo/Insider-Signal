Signal Staleness Analyzer

Calculates time-decay penalties for insider trading signals to ensure
only fresh, actionable signals receive high conviction scores.

Older signals are penalized because:
- Market conditions change over time
- Information gets priced in
- Insider knowledge becomes less relevant
